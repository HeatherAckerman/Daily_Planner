# Daily_Planner

For this project I was given some html and css starter code. I created a Daily Planner using a bootstrap container with rows and columns, inputs, and buttons. I added the time from Moment.js and set each of the inputs to preset classes that display if the time block is in the past, present, or future. In the future I will make the save feature functional.
